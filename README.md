# MEPsPerCommittee

As weird as it can sound, the European Parliament isn't very fond of spreading around the information about of the Members of the European Parliament e-mail addresses. However, those are an important tool for EU citizens who want to voice their oppinions and concerns to these elected members of the European Parliament.

After having to get some e-mail addresses time and again with boring, time-consuming and frustratring tasks, I finally got fed up, enough to actually create this repository which will allow you to generate a list of e-mail addresses of the MEPs who are working on a particular Committee.

This is a simple and ugly hack, and you'll have to tell which committee you're interested in (and even how many pages of MEPs does it have) by editing the actual script.

Pull requests, issues, enhancements and ideas are most welcome.
